# Go to the given directory:
cd path/to/directory

# Go to home directory of current user:
cd

# Go up to the parent of the current directory:
cd ..

# Go to the previously chosen directory:
cd -

# Go to a physical dir instead of default -L:
cd -P path/to/dir

# Some people alias cd="cd -P" and pwd="pwd -P"
# So that `ls ..` and `cd ..; ls .` yield the same thing.
