# Go to the given directory:
cd "$path_to_directory"

# Go to home directory of current user:
cd

# Go up to the parent of the current directory:
cd ..

# Go to the previously chosen directory:
cd -

# Go to a [P]hysical dir instead of default `-L`:
cd -P "$path_to_directory"

# Some people `alias cd="cd -P"` and `pwd="pwd -P"`
# So that `ls ..` and `cd ..; ls .` yield the same thing.
