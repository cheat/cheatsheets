# To output the byte and line number of the first difference found between two files:
cmp "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"

# To output the first differing char between two files:
cmp -b "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"

# To output every difference between two files:
cmp -b --verbose "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"

# To compare two files starting after the first 100 bytes:
cmp -i 100 "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"

# To limit to 200 the number of bytes to compare:
cmp -n 200 "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"

# To compare two files with no output - only exit status:
cmp --quiet "$path_to_file_1" "$path_to_file_2"
