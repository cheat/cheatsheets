# To output the byte and line number of the first difference found between two files:
cmp "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_2>"

# To output the first differing char between two files:
cmp -b "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_2>"

# To output every difference between two files:
cmp -bl "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_2>"

# To compare two files starting after the first 100 bytes:
cmp -i 100 "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_2>"

# To limit to 200 the [n]umber of bytes to compare:
cmp -n 200 "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_2>"

# To compare two files with no output - only exit status:
cmp -s "<path/to/file_1>" "<path/to/file_1>"
