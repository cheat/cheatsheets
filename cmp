# To output the byte and line number of the first difference found between two files:
cmp <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>

# To output the first differing char between two files:
cmp -b <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>

# To output every difference between two files:
cmp -b --verbose <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>

# To compare two files starting after the first 100 bytes:
cmp -i 100 <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>

# To limit to 200 the number of bytes to compare:
cmp -n 200 <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>

# To compare two files with no output - only exit status:
cmp --quiet <path/to/file_1> <path/to/file_2>
