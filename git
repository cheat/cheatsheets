# To view commits that will be pushed:
git log @{u}..

# To view changes that are new on a feature branch:
git log -p feature --not master

# To diff files WITHOUT considering them a part of git:
# This can be used to diff files that are not in a git repo!

# To unshallow a clone:
git pull --unshallow

# To create a bare branch (one that has no commits on it):
git checkout --orphan branch_name

# To checkout a new branch from a different starting point:
git checkout -b master upstream/master

# To remove all stale branches (ones that have been deleted on remote): So if
# you have a lot of useless branches, delete them on Github and then run this:
git remote prune origin

# To prune all remotes at once:
git remote prune $(git remote | tr '\n' ' ')

# Revisions can also be identified with :/text
# So, this will show the first commit that has "cool" in their message body

git checkout -p HEAD^ -- /path/to/file

# To revert a commit and keep the history of the reverted change as a separate revert commit:

# merge as this just applies a single commit from a branch to current branch:
git cherry-pick <commit SHA1>

# Change author of a commit:
git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"

# The GPG key used for signing your commits

# Sign new tags:
git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'

# Sign a commit:
git commit -a -S -m 'Signed commit'

# check any signatures it finds and list them in its output:
git log --pretty="format:%h %G? %aN %s"

# Defined the key to use for signing commits:
git config user.signingkey [KEYID]

# Set signing of commits globally:
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
