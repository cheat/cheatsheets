### Supported bootable USB creation methods:

# Completely WIPE the entire USB storage device, then build a bootable Windows USB device from scratch:
woeusb --device <source media path> <device>

# Copy Windows files to an existing partition of a USB storage device and make it bootable.  This allows files to coexist as long as no filename conflict exists:
woeusb --partition <source media path> <partition>



### Command Line Options:

# Verbose mode:
woeusb -v

# Specify the filesystem to use as the target partition's filesystem:
woeusb --tgt-fs <FAT/NTFS>
