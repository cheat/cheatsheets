# Authorization API for unprivileged programs ("Subjects") to access privileged Programs ("Mechanisms")
# polkitd is the system daemon

# see "man polkit" for details

# user created rules go to /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/
# after changing any of the directories all rules are reloaded

# example rule, allowing users in group "admin" to change users

polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
               if (action.id == "org.freedesktop.accounts.user-administration" &&
                   subject.isInGroup("admin")) {
                   return polkit.Result.YES;
               }
           });

# naming and preferences:
1. Rules in /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/ are favored over /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/
2. Lower numbers in the rule name are favored over higher numbers or no numbers

# example name: 50-libvirt.rules

# Polkit rule types:

addRule()
# whenever a program wants authorization, custom rules can skip that

addAdminRule()
# Whenever administrator authentification is required
