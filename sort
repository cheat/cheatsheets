# To sort a file:

# To sort a file by keeping only unique:
sort -u "<path/to/file>"

# To sort a file and reverse the result:
sort -r "<path/to/file>"

# To sort a file randomly:
sort -R "<path/to/file>"

# To sort a file and store the output in another file:
sort <inputFile> -o <outputFile>

sort -T <tempDirectory> "<path/to/file>"
