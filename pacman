# You can't directly install packages from the Arch User Database (AUR) with
# pacman. You need an AUR helper program such as `yay` or `paru` to do that.
# But considering that all of those are themselves in the AUR, here is how to
# do that manualy.
#
# Installing a package from AUR is a relatively simple process:
# - Make sure that you have the `base-devel` and `git` packages installed
# - Retrieve the repository corresponding to the package from the AUR website
# - Run `makepkg` in the cloned repository
# - Use `pacman` to install the created package
#
# Ensure that have `base-devel` and `git`:
pacman -S --needed base-devel git
# Retrieve the repository:
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/<package>.git
cd <package>
# Build the package:
makepkg -s
# Install:
sudo pacman -U <package (.pkg.tar.zst)>
