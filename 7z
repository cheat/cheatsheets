# Summary
A file archiver with the highest compression ratio.

    7z [subcommand] <path/to/archive.7z> <path/to/file_or_directory1 path/to/file_or_directory2 ...>

Subcommand can be one of the following letters:

    a: [a]dd
    d: [d]elete
    e: [e]xtract
    l: [l]ist
    t: [t]est
    u: [u]pdate
    x: e[x]tract with full paths

    DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix.
    7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.

    On Linux/Unix, in order to backup directories you must use tar :
      - to backup a directory  : tar cf - directory | 7z a -si directory.tar.7z
      - to restore your backup : 7z x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -

    If  you  want  to send files and directories (not the owner of file) to others
    Unix/MacOS/Windows users, you can use the 7-zip format.

# 7z exit codes
    0: normal (no errors or warnings)
    1: warning (non-fatal errors)
    2: fatal error
    7: bad cli arguments
    8: not enough memory for operation
    255     process was interrupted

# Example 1
Add all files in dir1 to archive.7z with default settings.
7z a archive.7z dir1

# Example 2
Add all files in dir1 to archive.7z with max compression
    7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1

    -t7z: 7z archive
    -m0=lzma: lzma method
    -mx=9: level of compression = 9 (ultra)
    -mfb=64: number of fast bytes for lzma = 64
    -md=32m: dictionary size = 32 Mb
    -ms=on: solid archive = on

# Example 3
Add (store) all files in dir1 to archive.7z without compression:
    7z a -m0=copy archive.7z dir1
