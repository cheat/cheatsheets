# To surround with the specified character:
`ys{motion}{character}`
ex: ysiw)		foo => (foo)
	ysiw(		foo => ( foo )
	ysiw]		foo => [foo]
	ysiw[		foo => [ foo ]
	ysiw<p>		foo => <p>foo</p>
	yss}		foo => {foo}	# surround the whole line with {} (ignores leading whitespace)
	ySS}		foo => {
							foo # indent the line and place it on a new line
					   }

# To change the current surrounding character:
`cs{old}{new}`
ex: cs([		(foo) => [foo]
	cs[(		[foo] => (foo)
	cs"<q>		"foo" => <q>foo</q>

# To delete the current surrounding:
`ds{character}` # delete the surrounding character
`dst` # delete the surrounding HTML tag
ex: ds(		(foo) => foo
	ds[		[foo] => foo
	dst		<p>foo</p> => foo

# To surround with function:
`ysWf{function_name}<CR>`
ex: ysWfprint<CR>	"foo" => print("foo")
	ysWFprint<CR>	"foo" => print( "foo" )
